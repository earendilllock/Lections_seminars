Code for Poly(A) Classification wtih HMM Features and Linear SVM

 Bo Xie (bo.xie@gatech.edu)

The provided code is written in Python and requires the following modules:
  1) numpy
  2) scipy
  3) liblinear

Liblinear can be obtained from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

The file poly_a_class.py exposes two main functions:
  1) TrainHMMFeatureClassifier
  2) PredictHMMClassifier

TrainHMMFeatureClassifier is used to train a classifier and PredictHMMClassifier
is used to make predictions about test sequences.

Two import parameters are d and k. d is the number of observations to combine
into mega-state and k is the equivalent number of hidden states. The user may
also need to choose the parameter C for SVM.
